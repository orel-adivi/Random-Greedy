## About the Project

"Random-Greedy" is the short name for this project, aiming to generate and compare low-rate deletion correcting codes.
This short name is also the name of out main artifact, a simple algorithm that provides better deletion correcting
abilities, compared to other codes we checked. In the project, eight methodologies for generating codes (some of them
with meta-parameters) were created, and compared for their deletion correcting abilities (so no insertions nor
substitutions are allowed). The codes are low-rate, so the number of codewords generated for each code is in
$O(log(n))$ for $n$ to be the maximal possible code space. Specifically, we generated the codes with the number of
codewords to be equal to the codeword length. The full description of the project is available in the
[project report PDF file](https://github.com/orel-adivi/Random-Greedy/blob/master/report/report.pdf).

This work is submitted as the final project in the course "Coding and Algorithms for Memories" (236379), at Taub Faculty
of Computer Science, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. The project was written by Orel Adivi
`(orel.adivi [at] cs.technion.ac.il)` and Daniel Noor `(daniel.noor [at] cs.technion.ac.il)`, and under the supervision
of Daniella Bar-Lev and associate professor Eitan Yaakobi. The work was done in semester winter 2022-2023. The project
is released under MIT license.
