# Support for Random-Greedy

Welcome to Random-Greedy!

"Random-Greedy" is the short name for this project, aiming to generate and compare low-rate deletion correcting codes.
This short name is also the name of out main artifact, a simple algorithm that provides better deletion correcting
abilities, compared to other codes we checked. In this project, we created eight code generators and compared their
deletion correcting abilities.

## How to Run?

Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/orel-adivi/Random-Greedy/blob/main/README.md)
